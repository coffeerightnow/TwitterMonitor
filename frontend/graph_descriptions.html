    <div>
        <p>This graph represents the tweets grouped by a hashtag that has been used in the same tweet together with the hashtag
            "#blockchain". It aims to show which topics, with a
            connection to the blockchain technology, are currently discussed the most on twitter.
        </p>
        <p> The data has been captured since October 2017.</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Click on the red bubbles to see which other hashtags are mostly used in the same tweet.
                    <br>So all tweets of each child node have at least all the hashtags of its parent(s) node inside.
                </li>
                <li>Move the slider to limit the number of child nodes displayed.</li>
                <li>Enter one from over 1'000 hashtags in the searchbar and see what other hashtags
                    have been used the most in the same tweet (and inherently also with #blockchain).</li>
